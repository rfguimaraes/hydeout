<details><summary><b>OWL2DL-CCC: A Corpus Generator for Ontology Repair</b></summary>
<p>

While there are already well-maintained corpora and methodologies to compare standard reasoners, there is still no standardise methodology or dataset
tailored for tasks such as Ontology Repair, Defeasible Reasoning, Inconsistent Tolerant Reasoner, and other non-standard applications.
The <a href="https://gitlab.com/rfguimaraes/owl2dl-ccc">OWL 2 DL Change Case Creator (OWL2DL-CCC)</a> provides a convenient and flexible way to generate a corpus of ontologies for these tasks using a set of ontologies, and set of specifications that indicate how these ontologies should be modified. It produces as output a set of files that can be easily parsed and employed when testing and benchmarking different tools aimed at OWL 2 DL ontologies.
