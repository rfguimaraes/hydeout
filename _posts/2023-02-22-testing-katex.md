I really like using LaTeX to write mathematical formulas.
Also, I believe that, at some point, it will be convenient to write at least some simple formulas here.
I looked for a ways of doing this here and [a post by Varun Agrawal](https://varunagrawal.github.io/2018/03/27/latex-jekyll/) stood out.
I followed the post (even though is 4-5 years old) and now comes the real test:

$$\forall x \exists y P(x, y) \rightarrow P(y, x)$$
