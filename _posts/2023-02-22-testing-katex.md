I really like using LaTeX to write mathematical formulas.
Also, I believe that, at some point, it will be convenient to write at least some simple formulae here.
After some searches I found exactly what I needed: [a KaTeX jekyll plugin](https://github.com/linjer/jekyll-katex).
Now I can have beautifully rendered mathematical (and logical) formulae in my posts such as:

$$\forall x \exists y P(x, y) \rightarrow P(y, x).$$
